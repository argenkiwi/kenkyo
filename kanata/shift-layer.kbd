;; The shift layer allows the user to pin shift to the space-bar by:
;; 1. Holding shift
;; 2. Holding space
;; 3. Releasing shift
;; The space-bar will keep the shift layer active until your release it.  The advanteage is that you can
;; type using the fingers of both hands freely. Consider it as an alternative to caps-word mode.
