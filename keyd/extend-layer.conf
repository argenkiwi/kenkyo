# The proposed navigation layer for this layoud is based on the Extend Layer.  Notice how you can pin the layer
# down with the space bar if you need to  do complex operations using the fingers of both hands.  Vim users might
# prefer to bind left, down up and right to h, j, k and l respectively as well as binding caps-lock to escape.
