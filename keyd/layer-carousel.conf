# This example demostrates how to implement a layer carousel which behaves as follows:
# - Hold space (numbers layer)
# - Tap right shift (functions layer)
# - Tap left shift (numbers layer)
# - Tap left shift (symbols layer)
# - Release space (main layer)
# By using swap in our secondary layers, the layer held by space (as determined in the
# main layer) is replaced and remains active until another swap takes place or the space 
# is eventually released, which brings us back to the main layer.
