# You can anchor the shift layer by holding space and immediately tapping the left shift
# key. Shift will remain active until the space-bar is released.
#
# Notice how we map both shift keys to the right shift key within the shift layer. This is
# just a workaround that makes the double-tap shift gesture possible in keyd.
