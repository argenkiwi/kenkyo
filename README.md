# Kenkyo
###### A layered keyboard layout for standard ANSI keyboards.

In this repository I intend to share configuration files for a range of keyboard customisation software which reprents a keyboard layout I developed under a series of principles.

> Kenkyo (謙虚) is the Japanese term for humility or modesty.

## Principles
- Seamlessness: A user that is unaware or the presence of this layout should not be able to tell it is there. 
- Progressiveness: A new user of the layout should be able to adopt the layout gradually and always have the option to fall-back to pre-existing habits if necessary.
- Composability: The layout should be built on well known patterns that can be applied together or individually.
- Efficiency: The layout should endeavour to strike a balance between the effort required for its use (i.e. hand motion) and that required to learn it (i.e., complexity).
