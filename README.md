# Kenkyo

A layered keyboard layout for standard ANSI keyboards

## Goal

In this repository I intend to share configuration files, for a range of free and open-source keyboard customisation software, which reprent a keyboard layout I developed, following a series of principles, with the objective of providing a template for those seeking to increase their productivity and/or improve the ergonomy of their workflows without having to spend too much money on expensive hardware or too much time doing research in order to experience the benefits of keyboard customisation.

> Kenkyo (謙虚) is the Japanese term for humility or modesty.

## Principles
- Seamlessness: A user that is unaware or the presence of this layout should not be able to tell it is there. 
- Progressiveness: A new user of the layout should be able to adopt the layout gradually and always have the option to fall-back to pre-existing habits if necessary.
- Composability: The layout should be built on well known patterns that can be applied together or individually.
- Efficiency: The layout should endeavour to strike a balance between the effort required for its use (i.e. hand motion) and that required to learn it (i.e., complexity).

## Patterns

- [Home row modifiers](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods)
- [Impermanent (momentary) layers](https://jonny-wamsley.gitbook.io/the-ultimate-guide-to-keyboard-layers/ch-3-layer-activators/3.3-shift-layers)
- [Layer pinning](https://argenkiwi.medium.com/keyboard-layer-pinning-20aafede96e5)

## Components:

- Main layer 
- [Extend layer](https://colemakmods.github.io/ergonomic-mods/extend.html)
- Shift layer (shift-bar)
- Layer carousel
